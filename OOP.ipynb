        "- **__new__(cls, args)**: A method unique to the new-style classes that executes before __init__ and that is responsible for constructing and returning the object itself. It is equivalent to the C ++ or Java constructors. It is a static method, that is, it exists independently of the instances of the class: it is a class method, not an object method, and therefore the first parameter is not self, but the class itself: cls.\n",
        "- **__del__(self)**: Method called when the object is to be deleted. Also called a destructor, it is used to perform cleaning tasks.\n",
        "- **__str__(self)**: Method called to create a text string that represents our object. It is used when we use print to display our object or when we use the str (obj) function to create a string from our object.\n",
        "- **__cmp__(self, other)**: Method called when the comparison operators are used to check if our object is less than, greater than or equal to the object passed as a parameter. It must return a negative number if our object is less, zero if they are equal, and a positive number if our object is greater. If this method is not defined and an attempt is made to compare the object using the <, <=,> or> = operators, an exception will be thrown. If the == or! = Operators are used to check if two objects are equal, it is checked if they are the same object (if they have the same id).\n",
        "- **__len__(self)**: Method called to check the length of the object. It is used, for example, when the len (obj) function is called on our object. As you might expect, the method should return the length of the object."
